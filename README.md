## Why JazmynOS?
Because this is my first operating system as a software developer, I'd like to name it after someone other than my mother and sister who means a lot to me. I eventually decided on the name Jazmyn after weeks of thoughtful consideration. For those who don't know, Jazmyn is the French version of Jasmine, and  I'm currently learning French as well as Spanish in high school. 

Anyway, I chose the name Jazmyn because it is my best friend's name. Jazmyn is a brilliant, adventurous, and extroverted individual. Jazmyn is one of three friends who have pushed me beyond my personal bubble and always had my back when I needed it the most. I honestly don't know who I would be without her, so I named my first operating system after her in honor of her beautiful name and charismatic personality.
